# Day 01 – Exploring AI Interactivity in Virtual Labs

## What I worked on
On Day 1, I explored how Virtual Labs can be made more AI interactive.
The focus was not on coding, but on understanding ideas, workflows, and
where AI actually fits in the Virtual Labs ecosystem.

## AI Ideas Explored
1. **Virtual Lab AI Assistant**
   - Helps students during experiments
   - Explains theory, steps, and common mistakes
   - Can be extended to multilingual support

2. **AI-Based Feedback System**
   - Provides real-time feedback based on user actions
   - Detects incorrect steps or unexpected values
   - Helps students learn from mistakes instantly

3. **Personalized Recommendation System**
   - Suggests experiments based on user progress
   - Identifies weak concepts
   - Makes learning adaptive and personalized

## High-Level Workflow
1. User interacts with the Virtual Lab (frontend)
2. User actions and inputs are captured
3. Data is sent to backend APIs
4. AI logic processes the data
5. Feedback or guidance is shown to the user

## Key Learnings
- AI should solve real learning problems, not just be added for hype
- APIs act as a bridge between the Virtual Lab and AI logic
- Even simple rule-based AI can add value
- Planning workflows is crucial before implementation

## Open Questions
- How to integrate AI with existing Virtual Lab code
- How backend APIs are built and connected
- Whether to start with rule-based AI or ML models

## Next Steps
- Learn API fundamentals
- Build a small backend API
- Start implementing simple AI logic
